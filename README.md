#### Project Pitch

**Real Estate Site (RES)** is a REACT/REACT-BOOTSTRAP/REACT-ROUTER app that accesses data from a web database. RES returns a collection of real estate properties for sale and rent. Each property has 13 attributes (id, address, city, state, zip code, listing price, bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet, listing date, property type, operation type, and image).

 The App fetches all the data as soon the browser load. Users can navigate between different links thanks to react-router features. Also, users can filter and search properties by price, property type, and operation type.

Additionally, the user can view details about a property by clicking the VIEW PROPERTY button, and immediately they will be sent to a new view where only the selected property is shown. Users can view more images once in the detail view by clicking on VIEW MORE IMAGES. A delete button is available to delete the selected property. Finally, users can add a new property to the database by filling out the form. Also, The user can view some statistic charts in the chart tab.

## Instructions:

 Users can access the app data through four main links in the navigation bar: Home, Properties, Tables, and Charts.

1.- Once the page load, the home page shows a few images and some information about real estate.

2.-All the data is fetched in the properties tab. The user can scroll down and check the collection of properties. There are two nested tabs in  Properties: List and Add New Property. The List tab is, by default, where all data is displayed. Also, the user can access more information by clicking on the view button, while Add New Property tab is where the user adds new real estate properties in the database.
