#### Project Pitch

**Real Estate Site (RES)** is a REACT-BOOTSTRAP app that accesses data from a web database. RSS returns a collection of real estate properties for sale and rent. Each property has 13 attributes (id, address, city, state, zip code, listing price, bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet, listing date, property type, operation type, and image). The App fetches all the data as soon the browser load. Users can navigate between different links thanks to react-router features. Also, users can filter properties by price, property type, and operation type.

Additionally, the user can view details about a property by clicking the VIEW PROPERTY button. Users can view more images once in the detail view by clicking on VIEW MORE IMAGES. A delete button is available to delete the selected property. Finally, users can add a new property. 

## Instructions:

The home page load, and all the data is fetched in the properties tab. The user can scroll down and check the collection of properties. Users can access the app data through two main links: Home and Properties.
