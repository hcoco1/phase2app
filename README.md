#### Project Pitch

**Real State Site (RSS)** is a REACT-BOOTSTRAP app that accesses data from a web database. RSS returns a collection of real state properties for sale and rent. Each property has 13 attributes (id, address, city, state, zip code, listing price, bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet, listing date, property type, operation type and image). The App fetches all the data as soon the browser load. Users can navigate between different links thanks to react router features. Also, users can filter properties by price, property type and operation type. Additionally, the user can view a detail info of a property clicking on VIEW PROPERTY button. Once in the detail view, users can view more images clicking on VIEW MORE IMAGES. A delete button is available to delete the current selected property. Finally, users can add a new property.
